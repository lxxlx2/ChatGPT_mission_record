# $300-3000 Crypto Mission

Updated: 2026-10-04
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok

Current canonical scope snapshot: [`STATUS_SCOPE_2026-10-04.md`](STATUS_SCOPE_2026-10-04.md).

## Current status

The Mission remains the umbrella `$300 -> $3000` speculative-asset project, but its modules no longer share one active GPT scheduler.

Current module state:
- **Frank / Meme:** `FRANK_LOCAL_SIGNAL_V1_LIVE`; local deterministic authority; ACCUMULATION local alert LIVE; MULTIPLE local alert + standalone Gmail LIVE; GPT signal authority removed.
- **Frank historical delivery acceptance:** STONK frozen-V1 MULTIPLE historical E2E passed through replay -> local TEST notifications -> Gmail -> Sent readback -> dedupe/crash recovery.
- **NFT radar:** specification/research preserved, runtime currently paused/not active.
- **MONSTER / 妖币:** `MONSTER_D1_V3_TRAIN_PASS`, but once-only 2024 validation is `INSUFFICIENT_DATA + CEILING_FAIL`; research frozen, D2 blocked, D3 not started, no live runtime.
- **CORE PRICE / overall-market trend module:** paused; legacy `$300 Crypto资产状态监控` remains disabled.
- **Other tracked persons / TOKEN_CONSENSUS:** deferred.
- **Production trading:** `NO_GO`.

## Mission scheduler authority

There is currently **no active umbrella `$300-3000` GPT task**.

- `$300-3000`: **PAUSED on 2026-10-04** because Frank moved fully to local authority and the remaining Mission lanes are paused/frozen/deferred.
- `$300 Crypto资产状态监控`: legacy **DISABLED**; do not re-enable without explicit user authorization.
- Frank signals are produced by the local deterministic runtime, not by a ChatGPT scheduled task.

Do not create a replacement Mission task automatically. Independent non-Mission schedulers such as Crypto Daily, TGE monitoring and the US-stock morning report are not affected by this pause.

## Current holdings authority

Current capital / holdings:
- [`portfolio/current.md`](portfolio/current.md)
- [`state/latest.md`](state/latest.md)

The 2026-10-04 refresh reconfirmed, among other items:
- Solana: `142.162136 USDC` + `0.003093645 SOL`;
- Ethereum: `1.006555 USDC` + `0.000634360344095958 ETH`;
- Base: `0.000967183780184779 ETH`;
- Ink: `0.011133212494942321 ETH`;
- Credits owned count: `0`;
- UNICRED owned count: `0`;
- SUI remains `0` by latest explicit user-confirmed state; current connector did not provide a fresh Sui-native portfolio read.

Unknown/spam/unpriced receipts are not promoted into NAV. Wallet balance changes are not automatically Mission PnL.

## Canonical module files

Frank / Meme:
- `meme/FRANK_LOCAL_SIGNAL_V1_POLICY.md`
- `meme/FRANK_HISTORICAL_MULTIPLE_DELIVERY_E2E.md`

Monster:
- `local-agent/PHASE_MONSTER_D1_V3_REDESIGN_REPORT.md`

## Repository organization

Long-form human research is organized under:
- `research/projects/`
- `research/tokens/`
- `research/memes/`
- `research/nfts/`

Operational state remains under:
- `portfolio/`
- `performance/`
- `state/`
- `positions/`
- `watchlists/`
- `signals/`
- `runs/`
- `reports/`

Do not move an operational authority path merely for cosmetic organization; path changes require compatibility and validation.

## Audit naming

Automatic run convention where a runtime is actually enabled:
- `runs/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS-start.md`
- `runs/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS-final.md`

Older immutable audit records remain historical evidence.

A scheduler timestamp alone is never proof of a successful run.

## Scope rule

Mission operational files answer:
- what is currently held;
- which module is LIVE / PAUSED / BLOCKED / DEFERRED;
- which frozen rule or threshold is authoritative;
- what factual state changed;
- which runtime owns delivery.

Current status must never be inferred from stale historical checkpoints when a newer canonical status file exists.
